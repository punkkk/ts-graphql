**Sample Typescript project**

If you want to start using typescript feel free to use this as a template

**Instruction**

1. ``chmod +x ./bin/set-up.sh`` to be able to start script
2. ``./bin/set-up.sh`` to clean up (you can use ``-c`` flag to delete `casual` package if you don't want to use it)

These commands will delete .git folder and initialize a new git repo for your project
